# Business Case: Leveraging Pre-Built Docker Container for ML Model Deployment  

## Executive Summary  
Developing and deploying machine learning models is resource-intensive. A typical organisation would require skilled machine learning engineers and software developers to train, wrap, and deploy a model into a production-ready environment. This case study evaluates the estimated effort, cost, and risk of replicating such a solution in-house versus adopting the provided pre-built Docker container.  

By using the pre-packaged container, organisations can reduce time-to-value from **20+ person-days** to near zero, with significant cost savings and risk reduction.

## Estimated Effort Breakdown  

| Activity | Description | Estimated Effort (Days) | Dependencies/Skills |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Model Training Setup** | Data prep, training pipeline, experimentation | 5 | ML Engineer |
| **API Development** | Designing and coding REST API (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) to expose model | 3 | Backend Engineer |
| **Local Serving Integration** | Model loading, inference logic, performance tuning | 2 | ML Engineer / Developer |
| **Testing (Model + API)** | Unit/integration testing, verifying accuracy and endpoints | 3 | QA / Engineer |
| **Dockerisation** | Write Dockerfile, containerise app, set up dependencies | 2 | DevOps Engineer |
| **Container Testing** | Verify container build, runtime checks, reproducibility | 2 | QA / DevOps |
| **Deployment Readiness** | Documentation, validation, packaging for production | 3 | Engineer / DevOps |
| **Total** |  | **20 Days** | |

## Cost Estimate  

Assuming development is performed in the UK (on-shore):  

- **Typical Contractor Rate (Senior ML/DevOps Engineer):** £500–£700 / day  
- **Full-time Equivalent (FTE) Loaded Cost:** ~£400 / day (incl. salary, benefits, overhead)  

### Replication Cost Estimate  

| Resource Type | Daily Rate | 20 Days | Cost Range |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Contractor (average) | £600 | 20 | **£12,000** |
| FTE Equivalent | £400 | 20 | **£8,000** |

## Benefits of Pre-Built Docker Solution  

- **Cost Avoidance:** Immediate savings of **£8k–£12k** compared to in-house build.  
- **Time Savings:** Container can be deployed in hours rather than weeks.  
- **Risk Reduction:** Eliminates risk of delays, errors in implementation, or dependency misconfiguration.  
- **Consistency & Portability:** Docker ensures the model runs identically across environments (local, cloud, hybrid).  
- **Focus on Value:** Teams spend time on **business use-cases and data insights**, not infrastructure setup.

## Conclusion  

Using the pre-packaged Docker container provides a **rapid, cost-effective, and low-risk alternative** to in-house replication. Instead of committing **20 person-days (£8k–£12k)**, organisations can deploy and operationalise the ML model immediately.  

This accelerates adoption, reduces technical risk, and frees valuable engineering capacity to focus on differentiating business priorities.
