{"text":" Sarah slammed the car door with enough force to rattle the windows of every vehicle in the parking lot. Her jaw was clenched so tightly that the muscles in her temples throbbed with each heartbeat, and her hands trembled as she fumbled for her keys. The meeting had been an absolute disaster, a complete waste of three hours that she'd never get back, and the worst part was that it could have all been avoided if people had just done their jobs properly in the first place.
The whole situation was utterly ridiculous. She'd spent weeks preparing for this presentation, working late into the night, sacrificing her weekends, perfecting every slide and rehearsing every transition until she could deliver it in her sleep. And for what? To sit in that suffocating conference room while incompetent colleagues who hadn't even bothered to read the preliminary reports asked the most basic questions that should have been addressed months ago.
The kitchen cabinet door slammed shut as she reached for a glass, the sound echoing through the apartment like a gunshot. Her movements were sharp and aggressive as she poured herself water, her grip on the glass tight enough to turn her knuckles white. Tomorrow she would have to walk back into that office, smile professionally at Johnson and Martinez, and pretend that nothing had happened. The thought made her jaw clench all over again.
But tonight, in the privacy of her own home, she allowed herself to feel every ounce of the fury that was coursing through her veins. Because some days, that's all you can do.
