After the evaluation period the container will not be able to decrypt the model file so the container will no longer run.

To extend the usefulness of the container email stevef1uk@gmail.com to request a new token.

On receipt of the token place it in this directory and run the script:

```bash
python  build-updated-image.sh
```
